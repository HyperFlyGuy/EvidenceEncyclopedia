title: Welcome to the Evidence Encyclopedia!
permalink: /

This site is meant to act as a encyclopedia for various types of forensic evidence. It is not meant to be flashy or fancy. It is meant for quick reference that will give analyst a brief explanation of an artifact and how they can best use it in their investigation. Please keep in mind that this is a side project and may not be completed. In my spare time I will gradually add to the site until it becomes as comprehensive as it can possibly be. With that being said, welcome to the evidence encyclopedia and I hope it helps!
