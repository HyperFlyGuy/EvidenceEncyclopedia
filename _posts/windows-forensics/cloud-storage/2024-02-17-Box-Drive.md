## Location and Format

Similar to other cloud storage applications there are a few locations that you need to be aware of.
    - Default reparse point to virtual filesystem:
        - %USERPROFILE%\Box
    - Default local file cache:
        - %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\cache
    - File metadata and configuration data:
        - %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\logs
            - Box_streem logs
        - %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\data
            - sync.db and streemsfs.db databases that contain **file** metadata
    - Metadata:
        - metrics.db - contains **user account information**

## Purpose

Box drive uses a virtual filesystem similar to Google Drive for Desktop. However, this file system is implemented as a NTFS reparse point. It also provides ***excellent*** metadata logging.

## Forensic Uses

Box drive provides us with metadata for both local and cloud-only files including the SHA-1 hash. There is more detailed usage logging that is available, but it typically only goes back a few weeks. **Quick Tip!** You can search "logDriveInformation" within the Box_Streem logs to identify the location of the virtual filesystem folder if it is not apparent.
